Once upon a time, in a forest, there lived a monkey who recided on a berry tree, which was on the banks of a river where lived a crocodile and his wife.
One day, the crocodile came to the banks of the river and rested under the tree. The kind hearted monkey offered him some fruits. The crocodile came back the next day for more fruits as he loved them. As days pasted by, the crocodile and the monkey became good friends.
